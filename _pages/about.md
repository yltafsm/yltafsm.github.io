I am a Research Associate at [Waseda Research Institute for Science and Engineering](https://www.waseda.jp/fsci/wise/), where I work with the [Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM)](https://www.jp.tafsm.org/en/laboratory). I received my PhD degree from Waseda University under the supervision of [Kenji Takizawa](https://www.jp.tafsm.org/en/members/kenji-takizawa) and [Tayfun E. Tezduyar](https://www.jp.tafsm.org/en/members).

My research focuses on developing advanced flow simulation and modeling methods for computational fluid--object and fluid--structure interactions analyses, and utilizing these methods to solve some of the most complex and challenging engineering problems in wind energy, urban air mobility, and biotechnology. The pioneering work of the [Carrier-Domain Method (CDM)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00466-022-02230-6), based on the [Space-Time Isogeometric Analysis (ST-IGA)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00466-024-02535-8) framework, has brought innovative powerful ways for high-resolution, blade-resolved computational analysis of wind turbines and wind turbine wakes at the wind farm scale.

To computationally study how a complex engineering system interacts with the physical world, it is important to work at the intersection of physics, computer science, and mathematics.

My research interests include, but are not limited to, the following directions:

- Computational aerodynamics with isogeometric analysis
- Mesh moving method
- NURBS mesh generation technique for complex geometry
