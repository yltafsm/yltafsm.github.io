Wind turbine wake flow. Full domain computation (_top_) and CDM-C computations (_bottom_). Isosurfaces corresponding to a positive value of the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor. The video shows a near-perfect match, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of the CDM in high-resolution 3D computation of time-periodic long-wake flows.
