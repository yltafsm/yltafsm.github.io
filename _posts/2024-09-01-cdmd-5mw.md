Wind turbine long-wake flow segments from CDM-D computation. Isosurfaces corresponding to a positive value of the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor. In the video, the Carrier-Domain moves in a discrete fashion, which is quite different from CDM-C, which differs significantly from CDM-C, both in terms of the mesh motion fashion and the computational approach.

The concatenated long-wake flow segments are obtained from a CDM-D computation once the flow solutions reach a periodic state. Isosurfaces corresponding to a positive value of the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor.
